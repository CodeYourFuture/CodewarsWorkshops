Step 1.  Read the instructions on codewars.  Do you understand what is being asked?  Are there any words you don't understand?  Can we separate the key information from the "story"/"context" information?
Step 2.  Look at the examples, you you understand the input and the output?  Describe what is input and what is output.
Step 3.  Work through the examples to check that you understand how the input/output relates to the problem statement.  Come up with at least ONE more example of correct input/output of your own.
Step 4.  In addition to the input and output, what else do we need to keep track of?

Step 5.  Can we come up with a sequence of steps that solve the problem?  These steps should take the input and generate the output.  DO NOT WRITE CODE.

From step 5 onwards, break down large problems into smaller ones.  Start with a sequence of steps that solve a subset of the problem (the simplest case of In/Out).  Start with a simple scenario.

Example - The elevator problem.
What is the simplest case we can consider?  I would say left=right is the simplest case, we always return "right".
Consider the case where left and right are equal: left=1, right=1, call=2,
The correct output is "right".
What is the step or steps to generate the output
When your solution solves the simple scenario, extend it to include another case.
A similar case is left and right are not equal but they are both equally near.
Consider the case left=3, right=1, call=2.  Again we should return "right"
Adapt your first step to include this case

You might notice that
return "right"
will work for both cases without any checking.

Lets add another case to consider so we will require us to check the value of left and right.
A new case left=3, right=0, call=2.

Step 6.  Check your steps.
Step 7.  Translate into code. (optional)
